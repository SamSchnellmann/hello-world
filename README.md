What's good world

I'm Sam Schnellmann. Uhh... I like to code and I'm really intrested in economics. I know 6 coding languages (Javascript, Java, C++, C#, Python, GML) and 2 real ones (English and Spanish). Favorite food is Lasanga. I've been listening to a lot of hip-hop / rap lately (Tyler the Creator, A$AP rocky, Kanye, Akon, J. Cole, Drake, Kenderick Lamar, just to name a few). And lastly I'm a sports nut. I watch a lot of sports, know each of the rules, know how to play them, and know the players. My favorite teams are: NFL - KC Chiefs, MLB - St.Louis Cards, NHL - St.Louis Blues, NBA - either: Bucks, Heat, Spurs, Raptors, Celtics (I don't watch the NBA as much as I should), MLS - St.Louis City, MMA - it really depends on who is fighting, but I really like "Sugar" Shawn and Connor McGregor rn, WWE - Rey Mysterio.
